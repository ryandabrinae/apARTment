### apARTment

Our project is a room decorator pulling from the Rijks Museum API to grab art from their 
database to save to the users collection. By logging in, the user can see all of the 
art in their gallery and can append it to their room. Then, with a color picker
generated from the database, the user can add their choice of furniture to a room and
color it from the color pallet.

### Approach Taken

We began wireframing each individual code. Then, our first priority was working with
our API to make complete calls to the database. Then, more Coffeescript was done for 
the color picker and room generator.
